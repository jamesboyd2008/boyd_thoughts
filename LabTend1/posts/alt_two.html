          <h2>Second Post</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browsing the internet, following whatever question arose in my imagination, I came across a video about obscure vehicles people have created. One such vehicle was called a <i>shaman</i>. Having recently been introduced to the idea of a shaman, I was intrigued regarding the nature of this vehicle and it's namer's familiarity with shamanism. Moreover, I'd like to know how many mechanical engineers are familiar with shamanism.  By <i>how many</i>, I mean how many in relation to the whole of mechanical engineers.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm interested in this because <a style="color: blue;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism">shamanism</a> has to deal with spirituality and non-physical concepts. Mechanical engineers have generally invested a significant portion of their life into understanding the physical world. I make up that this sheer volume of time invested is of such a magnitude that someone who would have gone forward in making that investment has a high probability of believing that topics like spirituality are a black hole, because they aren't as physical as other topics. Part of me thinks its a stretch that the person or people who designed and constructed that vehicle give a rip about shamanism, it being a niche subject in the first place.</p>
