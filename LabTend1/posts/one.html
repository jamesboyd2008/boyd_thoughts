          <h2>First Post</h2>
          <p>As the first post of my blog, I would like to establish the purpose of this blog: to share my thoughts. The scope of topics in this blog will not be unary. The intended audience is people who are interested in multiple topics. In my imagination, a reader would need to be interested in multiple topics to have an interest in me or what comes out of my mind, which is comparable to a bowl of spaghetti. I believe there is value in such a blog because there is catharsis is the shared realization that there is a blogger, and other readers, who host a diversity of interests and thought. There is much to be enjoyed in life beyond a single topic, such as materialism, sex stuff, or different flavors of greed and vanity.</p>
          <p>That last paragraph was pretty meta. How about dreams?  What is the purpose of dreams? Why do we dream? Do other animals dream? (yes (embed a video of a dog dreaming here)). Are we animals? </p>
          <p>Do you enjoy symantic debates? Do you enjoy investing your time on this earth in attempting to control other people's thoughts and actions? Do other people's thoughts and actions define you? Are other people's thoughts and actions <i>your</i> thoughts and actions? If your answer to the previous few questions in this paragraph were all "no", then I would be inclined to invite you to skip directly to the next paragraph. If a "yes" snuck in there, then I bid you well on your subsequent life-long journey to control other people, to define yourself by other people's thoughts and actions, to <i>be</i> other people, to be someone other than yourself.</p>
          <p>I'm confident that I don't know for certain what dreams are, or what their purpose is. I'm quite interested. I'm hella interested. As a side note, I would go so far as to say that I don't know <i>anything</i> for certain, or anything at all. I do believe that there are some notions I hold as truth that happen to be truthful, but I also believe cognitive certainty doesn't happen to humans. Much of our learning comes from <i>guess and check</i> experiences. I have a 99% certainty that I'm typing this blog post on a keyboard, but hey, this could all just be a dream.</p>
